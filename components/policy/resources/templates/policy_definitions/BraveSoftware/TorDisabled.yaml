  Disable Tor functionality in Brave.

  Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity by preventing any single point on the Internet (other than the user's device) from being able to view both where traffic originated from and where it is ultimately going to at the same time. This conceals a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis from any such point, protecting the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially.

            If this policy is set to true, Tor functionality will always be disabled.

            If this policy is set to false, Tor functionality will always be enabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, Tor functionality will be enabled by default.
